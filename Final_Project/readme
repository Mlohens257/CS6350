Note to project grader:
I was not able to download the data for this project to the Github some of the data is bigger than 25MB. 
The code won't run properly without the data and proper folder structure. 
I'd prefer to zip everything up and send it to the reviewer. 
Please let me know if you have another suggestion.

Once the data issue is worked out the following instructions can be followed to run the program:

The user has the option (prefered) of opening the .ipybn file and run the code line by line.
Or the user can open a terminal in the local folder that contains the .py file. Then in the command window type "bash run.sh" and hit enter.
